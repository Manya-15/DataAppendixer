## DATA APPENDIXER
Write with ease...

## Problem
Students, Teachers, Researchers spend a lot of time going through the whole webpages, data sets just to find the information related to a particular key word.
Many a times even after that also we are not able to get the perfect information that we wanted.
This leads to wastage of time for the user.


## How we are Solving it
The user will input the URL for the web page which he wants to read. He will then add the key word or term for which he wants the information to be collected.
The appendixer will then use the cosine similarity(NLP model) to find the nearest match.
At last the model will the most relevant paragraph to the user.


## Use of ai in the data appendixer
The model works on Natural Language Processing Branch of AI.
It uses Cosine similarity to find the match between the keyword inputted by the user and the data provided to find the most relevant sentence.
Later this sorted sentence is used to return the useful paragraph.
